We look at a simple Ox program that poses a puzzle about how computers do math.  The answer to the puzzle must wait for a later chapter, but the puzzle may motivate you to learn about how computers works before trusting them with your own research.</p>

<DT>Does $10x=\sum_{i=1}^{10}\ x$?</DT>
<DD><pre><span class="fname"><em><a href="./code/If6was9.ox" download>If6was9.ox</a></em></span>
<object height="400" width="95%" type="text/plain" data="./code/If6was9.ox" border="1" ></object></pre></dd>
<DT>The program does something simple twice. </DT>
<DD>A number is assigned to a variable, <code>x</code>.  </DD>
<DD>Then <var>10x</var> is compared to the value of adding <var>x</var> to itself 10 times.  </DD>
<DD>This is done first for <var>x=0.1</var> and then <var>x=0.25</var>.  </DD>
<DD>The program is supposed to print out <q>Yes</q> or <q>No</q> based on the comparison of the two expressions.</DD>

Of course, in <em>symbolic</em> mathematics the results are identical to each other.  But these operations are being carried out on a computer using digital mathematics not symbolic mathematics. The output when <code>10x.ox</code> is run is:
<DD><pre>--------------- Ox at 13:13:35 on 07-Sep-2012 ---------------

Is 2.5=10*(0.25)? Yes
Is 1.0=10*(0.10)? No</pre></dd>

You are supposed to be surprised by this output. Please stop and be surprise for a second.<br/>&hellip;</p>

If you can explain the output you might read the next few chapters quickly.  If you cannot explain the output then as a student of economics you should be thinking, <q>Perhaps I cannot trust Ox to do arithmetic.</q> After all, if you cannot rely on adding x to itself 10 times always being the same as 10x, for all values x, then how can we rely on it to, say, find a consumption bundle at which marginal utility equals the slope of the budget line?

<p/>
Is this is a flaw in Ox, a misunderstanding of the code, or something deeper?  The short answer is that it is indeed an inherent feature of numerical math and it illustrates a danger is naively using a language like Ox. if you use Stata can verify that it will produce the same puzzling output with this interactive output

<DD><pre><span class="dt">Stata also has a 10x 'problem</span>
. scalar x = 0.25
. di 2.5==x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x
1
. sca x = 0.1
. di 1.0==x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x
0
</pre></DD>
The outputs <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> are equivalent to <q>yes</q> and <q>no</q>. (Mathematica and Maple are designed to carry out symbolic operations, so this question would not apply to them, at least when they are in symbolic mode.)</p>

The reason for this puzzling behavior turns out to be a subtle feature of rational numbers. This is a curiosity but not ultimately a major issue in programming.  It is trotted out now to motivate you to be a bit curious and a bit wary about what is happening when you use the computer to do math.  Knowing how and why this happens will not make you a great economist, but it is a lesson along the way towards doing economics on the computer.</p>

<dT>You can run this program to try different values of <var>x</var>:</dT>

<h4>Some remarks about the Ox programs above.</h4>

In each case <code>main()</code> consists of the statements between the opening bracket (<code>{</code>) and its close (<code>}</code>). This makes <code>main()</code> a <em>function</em>, also called a <em>procedure</em>, a <em>routine</em>, and similar to things called <em>subroutines</em> and <em>methods</em>.   In these notes a function or method will usually be referred to with empty parentheses, like  <code>main()</code> instead of just <code>main</code>.  This might help the reader keep track of whether a variable or some other kind of object is being talked about rather than a function. The code inside <code>main()</code> consists of <em>statements</em>.  Ox is a kind of computer program in which the programmer tells the computer what to do in a sequence. A complete statement in Ox ends with a semicolon, <q>;</q>.</p>

The <code>if (condition) &hellip; ; else &hellip; ;</code> is a programming <em>structure</em>.   Like a function it includes other statements inside the structure.  At least two statements must appear, one after <code>if ()</code> and one after <code>else</code>.  Ox will check whether the condition inside <code>(&nbsp;)</code> is true (<code>then</code>) or not (<code>else</code>) and execute the corresponding statement.  But a <em>block</em> of statements is treated the same as a single statement. A block is created by putting statements inside curly brackets, just like <code>main()</code>.  If the logic of the program said that something should be done <code>then</code> but nothing has to happen <code>else</code>, then the program has two options.   Ox also has <code> if (condition) then </code>.  That is, you do not need to include <code>else</code> if it is not needed.  Or, you could put an empty block in your code: <code>else { }</code>.</p>

The statements that belong to <code>main()</code> and to <code>if () then else </code> are indented and preceded by four spaces, so that they appear to be inside, to belong to, <code>main()</code>.  The use of <em>indentation</em> in computer code is a simple thing that helps both you and any reader of your code to follow its logic. Later on we discuss other aspects of programming that do not affect what it does but does affect how humans can understand the code. My personal style of indentation is not the only way.  Some people may place <code>{</code> on the line after <code>main()</code> so that it is isolated and treated symmetrically with its partner <code>}</code>.   </p>

Those stylistic differences can be distracting but are less important than, say, following conventions of punctuation in English.  That's because in computer programming the syntax either reflects the programmer's intention <u>or not </u> regardless of the style of the coding. The reader of the source code can see the exact intention of the code whether if follows their preferred style or not (as long as the reader understands the computer languages rules of syntax and definition of things like <code>if () &hellip; else &hellip; </code>).  But in English punctuation and other conventions are followed in the hope of transmitting the meaning as accurately to the reader.  Unexpected notation could possibly change the meaning in the reader's mind.

You might be surprised, or perhaps not, that computer scientists have been known to actually argue about <a href="http:://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style">indent style</a>.</p>
The program <code>If6was9reprise.ox</code> can do much more than <code>hello world.ox</code> and in fewer lines.  It uses  an <em>iterative</em> statement  (<code>do { } while()</code>) to repeat a statement (or block of statements) more than once, which eliminates the need to have almost duplicate lines.  And it uses the conditional statement <code> A ? B : C</code> to check a condition (A) and return different values (B and C) depending on whether the condition is true or false.</p>

If the Ox code looks familiar it might be because you have already done some programming in C or other C-like languages.  This similarity was by design, but in many ways the similarities are only skin deep.  Ox is very different from C in how does things even when the programs look nearly identical and produce the same output.  More on that will be discussed later.
